### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Neo (they/them), a student who loves to code in C++ and Python. I'm passionate about creating new things and solving real-world problems using technology.

My areas of interest include data science, machine learning, and software development. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies that can help me become a better developer.

Here are some badges that represent my skills:
